I recently went through the process to configure my iTerm2 shell in macOS. Here is a quick guide to get it up and running in little to no time.

Once you have iTerm2 installed, we can switch the default shell to Zsh:

*Preferences > Profiles > General > Command - Select Command and enter "/bin/zsh"*


Now Zsh is the default shell.

Once you are using zsh by default, you can install Oh My Zsh, which is a framework managing Zsh configuration.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
``` 

At this point iTerm is now setup with Zsh so you can install powerlevel10k which is a Zsh plugin providing a powerline (a bar with different information). It is highly customizable and can show the path, git status, time, etc.

Start by downloading powerlevel10k into Zsh themes:

```
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k

``` 

After the theme is installed, you need to edit your configuration file- 

nano ~/.zshrc and modify the ZSH_THEME:


```
nano ~/.zshrc 
``` 
and modify the **ZSH_THEME**
```
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
``` 
After your file is saved, close iTerm2 and open it again. You should be prompted to how you want to customize your terminal settings. 

Enjoy!
