Quick and dirty-  
  
Run the following command on your PDC emulator:  

```
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:_timeserver_ /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update
```

 
 In my case, timeserver is a North American ntp pool server.  
  
```
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:0.north-america.pool.ntp.org /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update  
```



  
After this is done, restart the "Windows Time" service.  
  
  
After that is complete, run the following on all other DC's and restart the "Windows Time" service once complete.  
  
```
w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update  
```
