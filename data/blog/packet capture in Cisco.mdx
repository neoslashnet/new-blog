I've found that people sometimes get nervous running debug commands as well as captures. There are horror stories where you run a debug command and the firewall just locks up. 

I have been doing quite a bit of troubleshooting on site to site VPN tunnels and have had to get the some captures to confirm exactly what is happening. 

Below is a sample command you can use to match the traffic that matches the host 1.1.1.1 which in my case is the VPN peer IP address.


```
capture cap1 interface outside match ip host 1.1.1.1 any
``` 

Once the capture is configured you can view the capture by running the following command:


```
show capture cap1
``` 

You should see some information similar to this:


```
 2 packets captured
 
 1: 04:12:10.428093       192.168.10.10.34327 > 10.94.0.51.15868: S
    2669456341:2669456341(0) win 4128 <mss 536> Drop-reason: (acl-drop)
    Flow is denied by configured rule
 2: 04:12:12.427330       192.168.10.10.34327 > 10.94.0.51.15868: S
    2669456341:2669456341(0) win 4128 <mss 536> Drop-reason: (acl-drop)
    Flow is denied by configured rule
 2 packets shown

``` 

After you view the capture and don't need it anymore, you can clear all the captures on the ASA with the following command:


```
clear capture /all
```
